====== GLOSSARY ======

===== Abstraction =====

A generalisation, either through simplification(s) or by omission(s) of some (or more) part(s). For instance, the concept of "friendship" is an abstraction from all the individual instances of people being friends (an abstraction by generalisation). Similarly, the concept of "walking" is an abstraction of the concerted effort of all the muscles moving in the human body to effect that body walking on two legs (an abstraction by omission, because for "walking", all the unrelated information of muscles working, the brain balancing the body, the eyes determining the direction of travel, etc. is irrelevant), and the Japanese kana are abstractions of Chinese characters (either by simplification in the case of hiragana, or omission in the case of katakana).

===== Accent =====

Accent in speech is that part of a word that seems to jump out at the listener, placing more focus on one or more syllables than on the rest of the word. For instance, the word "attention" has its accent on "ten" in English, while the accent lies on "on" in French. Accents are typically in the form of a noticeably different pitch level or gradient for the syllable(s) in question than for the rest of the word.

===== Accusative =====

In this book, 'accusative' is used in the natural language meaning, not the grammatical meaning, representing a construction that accuses someone of something. The grammatical "accusative" form refers to the role of a direct object to a word that can take such direct objects (which typically means verbs).

===== Active =====

The verb form that describes actions taking place in the world, as performed by someone or something. For instance "I throw the ball" describes an activity performed by me. Contrast to "passive".

===== Adverb =====

Words that are used to describe the way in which a verb action or state is in effect. For instance, "To walk quickly" has the adverb "quickly" describing the way in which "walking" is performed.

===== Affirmative =====

A word or part of phrase that states ("asserts") something is the case. Contrast to "negative".

===== Animate =====

The quality of things that allows us to say they are alive, or seem lifelike. This covers not just things like people or animals, but also things that seem to move on their own, or even things which possess a "lively" quality, such as an animate conversation. Contrast to "inanimate".

===== Article =====

A particular kind of word that references particular objects. In English, these are the indefinite articles "a" and "an" and the definite article "the".

===== Assertive =====

Bold, confident, or even aggressively self-assured.

===== Attributive =====

Attributing a particular quality to something. For instance, used attributively, the word "blue" in the phrase "The blue book" attributes the quality "blue" to the object "book". Common attributive word classes include the adjectives (attributing quality to nouns) and adverbs (attributing qualities to verbs).

===== Auxiliary verb =====

A verb that is used to give additional meaning to another verb. For instance, in the English phrase "I can do this", the verb "can" is an auxiliary verb, combining with "do" to form a potential form, rather than a plain predicative form. These may also be referred to as 'helper verbs'.

===== Binary =====

Anything in which only two choices can be made, such as binary signals (high and low), binary numbers (zero or one) or any arbitrary choice ("one or the other"). Notice that no choice is ever truly binary, since there is always the choice to not pick either, and sometimes even allowing both to be picked, thus making binary choices secretly ternary choices, and  sometimes even quaternary choices.

===== Cardinal =====

A cardinal number differs from a normal number in that it refers to a number belonging to a particular set. Contrast this to ordinal numbers, which indicate a number is part of some sequence. For example, if we have a collection of 10 marbles marked 1 through 10, then the marble with number 6 written on it has cardinal number 6. However, if we look at in which order we can take the marbles out of some container and the marble marked with the number 6 is the first marble we pull out, then its ordinal number is 1 (because it's the first in the series of "drawn marbles"), but its cardinal number is still 6 (because it's still marble 6 in the collection of marbles).

===== Clause =====

A group of words that contain a subject and a predicate, but do not form a full sentence.

===== Cohortative =====

A word form or construction that suggests performing some action. In English, cohortatives are typically statements such as "shall we ...?" or "let's ...".

===== Colloquial =====

Spoken conversation, usually used to mean the informal spoken version of a language, as contrasted to formal language.

===== Commanding =====

A word form or construction that commands the listener or reader to perform some action. Contrast to "prohibiting".

===== Comparative =====

A word form or form of phrase that compares one or more things to each other in some way.

===== Compound =====

A word that has been formed by combining two or more words.

===== Conditional =====

A word form or construction that indicates something is dependent on something else happening, or being a particular way. The general description is in the form "If A, then B", with A representing a condition, and B representing the consequence should the condition be met.

===== Conjugation =====

A derived form of a verb, adjective or noun through inflection, either by modification, additions, or both.

===== Conjugational bases =====

A conjugational base is the most basic verbal "building block" in Japanese grammar, upon which all verbal inflections are built. These are: 1) the 未然形(みぜんけい), imperfect base, 2) the 連用形(れんよけい), continuative base, 3) the 終止形(しゅうしけい), finalising base, 4) the 連体形(れんたいけい), attributive base, 5) the 已然形(いぜんけい), perfective base, and 6) the 命令形(めいれいけい), commanding base.

Of these, the 終止形 is no longer used, and the 已然形 is also referred to as the 仮定形(かていけい) (potential base) in modern Japanese, as it is only used for hypothetical constructions.

===== Connotation =====

The commonly understood meaning of a word or phrase, rather than its literal meaning. For instance, "take a chair" connotes sitting down, rather than the literal taking of a chair. Contrast to "denotation".

===== Context =====

All information, both explicit and implied, that indicates how to interpret pronouns and referential information in one or more sentences.

===== Continuative =====

An inflection indicating that the action represented by the inflected word is still in effect, either 'as is', or as part of a more complex inflection.

===== Contraction =====

The phenomenon in which certain parts of speech get shortened by either dropping (series of) syllables or replacing series of syllables with shorter, different syllables. An example of this in English is the word "cannot" being turned into "can't" through omission. An example in Japanese is なければ being turned into なきゃ through a combination of omission and replacement.

===== Contrasting =====

Showing two things as being different in one or more respects. The biggest possible contrast is called polar contrast, where two things are presented as opposites ('lying on opposite poles'), rather than merely differing.

===== Copula =====

A word or part of phrase used to define, or couple, things. In English, this is the verb "to be", which is used in definitions, such as "the sky is blue". In Japanese, these are a large number of copulae, with the two words だ and です being the most used, for informal and formal coupling respectively.

===== Counter =====

A word used to indicate that a numerical statement should be considered as representing a count of some thing(s), rather than a plain number.

===== Decomposition =====

Reducing compound constructions to their individual parts.

===== Deferred =====

Indirect.

===== Denotation =====

The literal meaning of a word or phrase. For instance, "take a chair" denotes actually physically taking a chair, and nothing else. Contrast to "connotation".

===== Derogative =====

A word or phrase that suggests someone or something is worth less than they really are. Belittling, detracting, expressing low opinion of.

===== Desirative =====

A word or phrase that expresses desires.

===== Diacritic =====

===== Direct =====

Not hiding one's true intentions behind suggestive phrasing or formality patterns, "speaking one's mind".

===== Direct object =====

That part of phrase that receives the action of a transitive verb. For instance, in "I throw a ball" the word "ball" as direct object receives its action from the verb "throw". Contrast to "indirect object", compare to "subject".

===== Future tense =====

===== Genitive =====

Expressing a word or part of phrase belongs to, or is specified by, another word or part of phrase. From the Latin "genitus", meaning "begotten".

===== Gerund =====
