An introduction to Japanese - Syntax, Grammar & Language
========================================================

This is the new repository for the data that is used to
generate the book "An introduction to Japanese" as found
at http://www.amazon.com/dp/9081507117 and other stores.

I've been running it as a dokuwiki for a few years on
http://grammar.nihongoresources.com and that has proven
to be useful, but progressively harder to maintain as
dokuwiki changes its APIs, and my content relies on
specific dokuwiki plugins for which I don't have time
to actually update them to work with the new versions.

So, I'll be trying to rewrite it to a self-contained
website that you can file github issues for, with a
php compiler to turn the raw data into .pdf data.

Interesting fact: just because someone's front door
is open doesn't mean you have the right to take their
stuff, and in the same vein: just because I'm hosting
this on a public repository does not give you the right
to use the code and raw data for your own purposes.

This book is [free for the general public in PDF form](data/pdf/draft.pdf),
and available as the more traditional (affordable, gasp!)
paper textbook version at book retailers, but this is
a product, not a project: all code and data is owned by
me, Mike "Pomax" Kamermans, and I reserve all rights.
You expressly do not have permission to start compiling
your own version (except to test the compilation from
plain text to .pdf), nor do you have permission to
distribute this code or data yourself.

You are, however, welcome to help improve the text,
or suggesting compile improvements, by filing issues
or submitting pull requests. Contributions deserve
acknowledgements in the book's acknowledgement section.
